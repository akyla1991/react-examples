# react-examples
This is a react examples demo project. This repo is for play, test and demonstrate my skills with React and related frameworks.
Some of the technologies used are:
* Bootstrap Slate theme. no jQuery or any other DOM manipulation library. The idea is to be a pure React ecosystem.
* react-router
* webpack and webpack-dev-server with HMR
* flux example page
* ES6 whenever possible. Actually there is a mix on defining component: some are written with pure ES6 classes, some not. This is intentional to try out different styles.
* Babel with ES6 and JSX transforms, and also some experimental plugins like babel-plugin-react-html-attrs
* TODO: redux, continue building more complex react examples, css-modules and styles


## Setup
1. run: `npm install`
2. and then `npm run dev` to build with webpack and start the local server with HMR
3. test in localhost:8080
